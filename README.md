Age Calculator App
This is a work-in-progress application that calculates a user's age based on their birth date. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
User-friendly interface for inputting birth date
Real-time age calculation
Responsive design for mobile and desktop
How It Works
The user inputs their birth date in the form of day, month, and year. The application then calculates the user's age in years, months, and days by comparing the current date with the inputted birth date.

The age calculation is done using JavaScript. When the user inputs their birth date, an event listener triggers a function that calculates the age. The function subtracts the birth date from the current date to get the age in milliseconds, then converts this to years, months, and days.

The application also includes error handling. If the user inputs an invalid date (e.g., a future date), the application displays an error message and changes the color of the input field and label to red.

The application's interface is built using HTML and CSS. It features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, making it accessible on both mobile and desktop devices.

Future Improvements
This application is still a work in progress. Future updates will include:

More comprehensive error handling
Improved user interface
Additional features based on user feedback
